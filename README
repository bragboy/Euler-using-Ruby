His talk steps back to take a look at the mobile environment and what your options are as a designer to help you choose the right path for you and your audience: do we implement a native app or build a web-based interface? Deciding which platform to target doesn&#8217;t hinge only on tech specs or audience reach. Every mobile OS has a different personality, design sensibility, and even government, all of which determine how well your individual app (and its audience) will thrive. Discover the cultural and practical considerations of choosing the right platform(s) for your app and audience, and of crafting a design that works for all.</p>",
