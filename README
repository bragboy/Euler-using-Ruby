Linda Rising explains that this hardwired trust evaluation can get in the way of working well with others. Pairing, the daily stand up, and close communication with the customer and others outside the team go a long way to overcome our instant evaluation of others. As Linda helps you gain a better understanding of this mechanism in your behavior and what agile processes can do to help, you are more likely to build better interpersonal relationships and create successful products.</p>",

For many, this void has long made enterprise Java development an arduous undertaking. While development life is simple with unit tests and mocks, they only take you so far. Eventually, you need to validate how your components interact and operate in their intended environment&#8212;you need real integration tests. Yet, writing integration tests has meant assuming the burden of bootstrapping all or part of your infrastructure. That&#8217;s time lost and it places a mental barrier on testing.</p>\n<p>Arquillian, a container-oriented testing framework layered atop TestNG and JUnit, tears down this barrier. It does so by bringing your test to the runtime rather than requiring you to manage the runtime from your test. Picking up where unit tests leave off, Arquillian enables you to test real components that rely on real enterprise services in a real runtime. What&#8217;s the secret ingredient?</p>\n<p>This talk will show how Arquillian simplifies integration testing by providing a component model for tests, just as Java EE 5 simplified server-side programming by providing declarative services for application components. The test component model consists of container lifecycle management, test enrichment (dependency injection), container deployment and in-container test execution. Using a component model means your tests are portable and able to move between different environments, from single embedded or remote to multi-server to multi-cloud nodes.</p>\n<p>Attend this talk to learn about the future of Java enterprise testing.</p>",

The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction &#8211; and Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actors together with Software Transactional Memory (<span class=\"caps\">STM</span>) to create a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and <span class=\"caps\">OUT</span> (utilizing the grid/cloud). Akka provides location and network transparency by abstracting away both these tangents of scalability by turning them into an operations and configuration task. This gives the Akka runtime freedom to do adaptive automatic load-balancing, cluster rebalancing, replication and partitioning. In this talk you will learn what Akka is and how it can be used to solve hard scalability problems. We will also walk you through a real-world case-study using Akka to implement a highly scalable and fault-tolerant compute grid. Akka is available at http://akka.io (under Apache 2 license).</p>",

The interesting problem comes when money enters into the equation. Research shows that when someone works on something for free for internal rewards, those internal rewards are replaced if you start paying them. Then if you stop paying them, they will stop working on it. So when people get paid to work on open source software, does that change things? If their free web application starts making money, does that change things? How can companies work with these open processes and technologies in a productive way?

With clouds, however, we can launch &#8212; and decommission &#8212; entire virtual data centers instantly. This accelerates the cycle time of IT. It&#8217;s analogous to two other shifts in technology: agile software development methodologies, and the &#8220;devops&#8221; movement of self-scaling, self-healing architectures. We&#8217;ll see how the fates of clouds, agile coding, and devops are intertwined, and what this means for IT professionals.</p>\n<p>In this session, John Willis (the co-host of the popular Devops Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and the IT Management &amp; Cloud Podcast) will catch you up on what Devops is looking like and how it might help (or harm!) you. This session will give you a pragmatic overview of Devops and leave with a better idea of how Devoops applies to you and your organization.</p>",

You will learn how these features provide a platform for message-driven architecture. You will also learn about Spring&#8217;s support for Hohpe and Woolfe&#8217;s Enterprise Integration Patterns. This includes demos of several basic patterns such as Message Channel, Message Transformer, and Message Router, as well as composite patterns such as Scatter/Gather using a Splitter and Aggregator. The examples will also cover different options for adding custom integration logic within the configuration-driven context. Those options include not only POJOs, but also Spring 3.0&#8217;s Expression Language and Groovy scripts. Finally, you will see Channel Adapters and Messaging Gateways that support <span class=\"caps\">JMS</span>, Web Services, Email, and more.</p>",

That&#8217;s why in this talk, we&#8217;ll showcase how the latest developments in the Java EE platform and ecosystem have brought new meaning to the double E: &#8220;Easy&#8221; and &#8220;Extensible&#8221;.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll begin by summarizing the functionality Java EE 6 gives you out of the box. Hint: intelligent defaults replace <span class=\"caps\">XML</span> and disparate technologies have been connected by powerful services like <span class=\"caps\">CDI</span>. We won&#8217;t pretend that one size fits all. You&#8217;ll discover that the closed feature set has been abolished with the inclusion of the <span class=\"caps\">CDI</span> extension facility. You now have the choice of building new features into the programming model in addition to using what&#8217;s provided. That still leaves a lot of work. So we&#8217;ll appeal to your practical side and highlight some of the extensions Seam 3 already has prepared for you.</p>\n<p>Despite all these features, the code isn&#8217;t going to write itself. Or can it? Throughout the talk, you&#8217;ll witness how Forge can incrementally assemble an application at your command. At the end of the talk we&#8217;ll remind you of the fact that you are doing all this with the Enterprise Edition of Java without any of the pain that would seem to imply. Now that was easy.</p>",

Deciding which platform to target doesn&#8217;t hinge only on tech specs or audience reach. Every mobile OS has a different personality, design sensibility, and even government, all of which determine how well your individual app (and its audience) will thrive.
